# Background Music

This is a very simple website that plays music and ambiance videos at the same time,
with smooth volume transitions between them. It's a very poorly constructed website,
made in a few minutes. I know the source code is a mess and that's alright.

# TODO

[ ] Persist settings and playlist
[ ] Mobile/vertical layout
[ ] Quick fade out on next music
[ ] Fix some weirdness when loading a new video, some problem with seekTo
[ ] Maybe change how we do the entire volume/progress thing, to a less frame-based way...
    > Although, the frame-based way is more resistant to changes directly to the player
